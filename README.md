# Introduction to University Mathematics (M40001/M40009) : additional Lean material

Lean is not an official part of Imperial's Introduction to University Mathematics course, but a lot of the material in Parts I and II is really nice to do in Lean.

If you are taking the course in October 2021 and you are looking to try doing some of the material in Lean then you should head on over to the 2021 page [here](src/2021/README.md).

For the best user experience it's worth installing Lean on your own computer. This course will be in Lean 3. Instructions on how to install Lean 3 and "mathlibtools", tools which will make doing mathematics in Lean 3 much easier, then head on over to [the installation page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) on the Lean community website. Once you have done this you can just install this M40001/M40009 Lean project by firing up the command line you used to install Lean and typing


```
leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/M40001_lean
```
