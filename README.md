# M40001/M40009 example sheets and course notes in Lean.

M40001/M40009 is the "introduction to proof" course in the maths department at Imperial College London. I (Kevin Buzzard) am formalising the part of the course that I am running.
Over time expect course notes and example sheets to appear.

# How to try the example sheets in Lean

## Try the example sheets online

Use the following links:

**TODO** link to sheet 1 
**TODO link to sheet 2 etc

## Download the project and try the example sheets on your own computer

This only works if you have Lean and mathlib installed.
Instructions for installing Lean and mathlib are at
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib#installation HERE (**TODO make link**)

If lean and mathlib are installed, then install this project by typing this:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ImperialCollegeLondon/M40001_lean.git
$ cd M40001_lean
/M40001_lean$ leanpkg configure
/M40001_lean$ update-mathlib
```
