# Part I of IUM 2021 in Lean

I lecture Part I of Imperial's "Introduction to University Mathematics". There are three example sheets in Part 1 of IUM 2021. The first is on logic and sets, the second is on functions, and the third is on binary relations. 

Lean is a computer game which turns example sheet questions into levels of a puzzle game. Of course, you have to learn a bit of Lean before you can do them, so we won't dive straight into the example sheets; first I need to teach you how to prove basic stuff like "show that P implies P".

The links below should hopefully serve as a tutorial for how to use Lean to do IUM problems. Start with the [logic](logic/README.md) link below.
