# Part I of IUM 2021 in Lean

There are three example sheets in Part 1 of IUM 2021. The first is on logic and sets, the second is on functions, and the third is on binary relations. Many of the example sheet questions are quite tricky for a beginner to work on in Lean, so I have written a bunch of more basic questions, together with hints on how to do them. These questions should hopefully serve as a tutorial for how to use Lean to do IUM problems. Start with the `logic` link below.

I have divided this tutorial up into four sections. The `logic` section just introduces you to the basics of how Lean works; the other sections assume you have worked through this part.

* [logic](logic/README.md)
* [sets](sets/README.md)
* [functions](functions/README.md)
* [relations](relations/README.md)
