# Logic in Lean, example sheet 3 : "not" (`¬`)

We learn about how to manipulate `¬ P` in Lean.

## Tactics

You'll need to know about the tactics from the previous sheets,
and also the following tactics:

* `change` (optional)
* `by_contra`
* `by_cases`

### change

The `change` tactic changes a goal to a goal which
is *equal to it by definition*. The example you need to know
is that `¬ P` and `P → false` are equal by definition.

If your goal is `⊢ ¬ P` then `change P → false,` will
change it to `P → false`. Similarly if you have a hypothesis
`h : ¬ P` then `change P → false at h,` will change it to `h : P → false`.

Note that this tactic is just for psychological purposes. If you finish
a proof which uses this tactic, try commenting out the `change` lines
and note that it doesn't break.

### `by_contra`

If your goal is `⊢ P` and you want to prove it by contradiction,
`by_contra h,` will change the goal to `false` and add a hypothesis
`h : ¬ P`.

### `by_cases`

If `P : Prop` is a true-false statement then `by_cases hP : P,`
turns your goal into two goals, one with hypothesis `hP : P`
and the other with hypothesis `hP : ¬ P`.
