Problem Sheet 1, October 2019.

This is a Lean file. It can be read with the Lean theorem prover.

You can work on this file online at

or you can install Lean and its maths library following the
instructions at
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib

There are advantages to installing Lean on your own computer
(for example it's faster), but it's a lot more hassle than
just using it online.

In the below, delete "sorry" and replace it with some
tactics which prove the result.

-/

/- Question 1. 

Let P and Q be Propositions (that is, true/false statements).
Prove that P ∧ Q → Q ∧ P. 

-/

lemma question_one (P Q : Prop) : P ∧ Q → Q ∧ P :=
begin
  sorry
end
/-

For question 2, comment out one option (or just delete it)
and prove the other one.
-/

-- Part (a): is → symmetric? 

lemma question_2a_true : ∀ P Q : Prop, (P → Q) → (Q → P) :=
begin
  sorry
end

lemma question_2a_false : ¬ (∀ P Q : Prop, (P → Q) → (Q → P)) :=
begin
  sorry
end

-- Part (b) : is ↔ symmetric?

lemma question_2b_true (P Q : Prop) : (P ↔ Q) → (Q ↔ P) :=
begin
  sorry
end

lemma question_2b_false : ¬ (∀ P Q : Prop, (P ↔ Q) → (Q ↔ P)) :=
begin
  sorry
end

/- Question 3.

Say P, Q and R are propositions, and we know:
1) if Q is true then P is true
2) If Q is false then R is false.

Can we deduce that R implies P? Comment out one
option and prove the other. Hint: if you're stuck,
"apply classical.by_contradiction" sometimes helps.
-/

lemma question_3_true (P Q R : Prop) 
  (h1 : Q → P)
  (h2 : ¬ Q → ¬ R) : 
R → P :=
begin
  sorry
end

lemma question_3_false : ¬ (∀ P Q R : Prop,  
  (Q → P) →
  (¬ Q → ¬ R) → 
  R → P) :=
begin
  sorry
end

/- Question 4.

   Your friend is thinking of three true-false statements P, Q and R,
   and they tell you the following facts:
   a) P → (Q ∧ R)
   b) Q → (R ∧ ¬ P)
   c) R → (P ∧ ¬ Q)

   What can you deduce?

In this question you must *change the conclusion* to explain
   what you deduced.
-/

lemma question_4 (P Q R : Prop)
  (h1 : P → (Q ∧ R))
  (h2 : Q → (R ∧ ¬ P))
  (h3 : R → (P ∧ ¬ Q)) : 
P ∨ Q  -- replace this line with your conclusion
:= 
begin
  sorry
end

/- Question 5.

  Say that for every integer n we have a proposition P n.
  Say we know P n → P (n + 8) for all n, and
  P n → P (n -3) for all n. Prove that the P n are either
  all true, or all false. 

This question is harder than the others.
-/
lemma question_5 (P : ℤ → Prop) (h8 : ∀ n, P n → P (n + 8)) (h3 : ∀ n, P n → P (n - 3)) :
(∀ n, P n) ∨ (∀ n, ¬ (P n)) :=
begin
  sorry
end

/-
The first four of these questions can be solved using only the following
tactics:

intro
apply (or, better, refine)
left, right, cases, split
assumption (or, better, exact)
have,
simp
contradiction (or, better, false.elim)

The fifth question is harder.
